# yunyun

Ahh, [Yunyun](https://konosuba.fandom.com/wiki/Yunyun) from the fantastic
[KonoSuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba). 

`yunyun` is the lowest-level package, which should not import anything else from
`darkness`, as it contains all base- and internal-level structs plus definitions.

Why `yunyun`? In the story, she is the supporter of her village. True heir, who
always helps her friends, and never really truly appreciated for all her efforts.
It seems fitting for a package that is truly helping every other, but not including
any other package.
