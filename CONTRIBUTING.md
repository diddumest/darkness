# Rules of engagement

There is no committee, no board, no team, and none of that bureaucracy shit.
We are here for the love of the game. Want to add a new functionality? Pull
request it in and we will take a look at it together.

I only recommend adding something because you need it, rather because it would
be nice to have. This could help us ensure that the ground covered and footprint
is as tight and as functional as possible.

# A kind request

Because this started and continues to be a project of super passion—please name
your module, package, command, whatever with an anime character's name. Doesn't
matter which one (within the veil of common sense, of course).

If you have trouble picking one—ask through PRs or contact me at darkness@sandyuraz.com
and the world is our oyster.

*Now go! Let the legend come back to life.*
