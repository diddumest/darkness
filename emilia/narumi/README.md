Narumi is a hard-working office worker with a secret love for manga, anime and novels
that feature romantic relationships between men. She truly performs a huge amonut of 
work here as `narumi`, responsible for all kinds of AST traversal and enrichments,
which are later bundled up by `chiho`.

But maybe she also has some sort of secret here too? ðŸ˜³
