[Alpha Hatsuseno](https://yokohama-kaidashi-kikou.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha_Hatsuseno) from the 
amazing [Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D). She runs
her quite cafe at the end of the world, for everyone to enjoy life as it passes by. 

I like to think of the story more of as a beginning, rather than the end. This is why, the package
`alpha` is responsible for bootstrapping `darkness` with all the settings, properties, etc. when
ingesting config files, etc.
