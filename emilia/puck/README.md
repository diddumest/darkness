# puck

[Puck](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Puck) is an artificial spirit from 
[Re:Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Zero) that Emilia was formerly contracted with.

Seems very reasonable to have `puck` as the sub-package of `emilia`, which provides all
sorts of constants and hard static values.
