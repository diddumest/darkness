# emilia

[Emilia](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Emilia), [emilia](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Emilia),
[emilia](https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Emilia). I would never understand her, but she somehow
seems **very** important in the story of [Re:Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Zero). Many
which call the best anime ever made---I can definitely see that.

So, Emilia is supposed to somehow lie at the source of it all---same way, `emilia` the package is
the source of the logic of darkness. It is the true logic and mustle package, which does all the
heavy lifting.

Whereas `yunyun` is the schemas, `ichika` is the entrypoint, `emilia` is the brain behind it all.
