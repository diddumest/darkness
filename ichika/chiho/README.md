[Chiho Sasaki](https://the-devil-is-a-parttimer.fandom.com/wiki/Chiho_Sasaki) from
[The Devil Is a Part-Timer!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Is_a_Part-Timer!) is a teenage
girl fallen in love with the great devil, who now works at MgRonald (haha).

In the story, she always brings people together. In this case, `chiho` enriches the extracted
pages in `darkness` by traversing them, resolving comments, dynamically adding math, etc.

In a compiler speak, `chiho` would be the AST walking step, probably, name-checker and type-checker combined.
