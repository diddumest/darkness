# makima

[Makima](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Makima) is of course our beloved pathological
manipulator from [Chainsaw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man).

Because we pass in a single object, a pointer, which values and fields constantly get 
populated and hydrated from one stage to another, it is being served as a "control"
structure.

This seems very fitting. As `makima` is controlling each page's lifetime throughout
the building process.
