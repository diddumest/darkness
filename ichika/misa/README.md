# misa

This is of course, [Misa Amane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misa_Amane) from
[Death Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note). Misa includes all tools
and processes, which would be nice to run on the final output, but aren't considered
"breaking". Like RSS feeds, putting holoscene html alt texts, blurring galleries, etc.

In a compiler speak, this would be the machine code level optimization. Why `misa`?
I just love her. She is enough.
