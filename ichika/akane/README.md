# akane

Akane from the titular manga, [Akane-banashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akane-banashi). Great
story of her becoming (or at least where I am now, striving to become) a [rakugoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo).

Because in rakugo,

> Using only a paper fan (扇子, sensu) and a small cloth (手拭, tenugui) as props, 
> and without standing up from the seiza sitting position, the rakugo artist depicts
> a long and complicated comical (or sometimes sentimental) story.

I always saw it as a "closing act" of something grander, or like the climax of the evening. Therefore,
`akane` the package handles the post-processing of the `darkness` build.

In a compiler speak, `akane` would be taking the form of an IR optimization layer.
